**What is LC-3 Computer ?**
Little Computer 3, or LC-3, is a type of computer educational programming language, an assembly language, which is a type of low-level programming language.

It features a relatively simple instruction set, but can be used to write moderately complex assembly programs, and is a viable target for a C compiler. The language is less complex than x86 assembly but has many features similar to those in more complex languages. These features make it useful for beginning instruction, so it is most often used to teach fundamentals of programming and computer architecture to computer science and computer engineering students.
